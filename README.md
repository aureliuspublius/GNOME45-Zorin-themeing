# GNOME 45 Zorin Themeing
Porting Zorin OS themes to GTK-4 / GNOME 45 standards (unofficial community project)

Since Zorin OS 17 ships with GNOME 43, its beautiful theme does not support the newest GNOME 45 shell and applications. This makes sense, since we don't want our beloved devs working extra for something Zorin doesn't support. However, many of us might tinker with an unsupported upgrade to GNOME 45 or even use different distro altogether that uses GNOME 45. Wouldn't it be great to create an unofficial (community) version of the Zorin themes for the world to enjoy?

That's where this repo comes in. To begin with the most popular theme first, this will include Zorin Blue Dark to master the process before replicating it for every other theme option.

Here are examples of the work in progress:

And here is a clear area in need of improvement, the NewsFlash app:
